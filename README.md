# Lab 7 (React Catalog Page)
## Task
Continue work on your React App by adding a page with Items list (see the link to wireframe of Catalog page above).

## Requirements
Requirements:
 - All of the requirements for previous React.js works should be kept.
 -  Code style:
  - Use array.map() method for rendering your items list
  - Routing (switching between pages) should work now. Use react-router-dom library: https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start
  - All UI elements (buttons / select) should have corresponding React components (PrimaryButton.jsx / Select.jsx  etc.)
 - Functionality (filter / search / view more) is still not required (you have to complete it on next works)
## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
