# Lab 6 (React Landing Page)
## Task
Start creating your React App with a simple Home page (see the link to wireframe above). Your e-commerce app subject is about your entities from previous (3-5) works.

## Requirements
Requirements:
 - You have to use only React.js library for all of your mark-up. Which means - your index.html file shouldn’t be touched.
 - Use create-react-app tool for creating base of your project
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
 - Your Home page should follow the wireframe, i.e all of the elements ( header, navigation, footer etc. ) from wireframes must be presented on your website.
 - Design: You have to use CSS styling or/and component libraries. Don't overthink it, use your imagination for UI, BUT the work with almost no styling is unacceptable.
 - Functionality: For this work nothing but view only part is required. Any interaction (links/buttons) is not necessary, but you will have to complete them in your next labs.
 - Code style:
   - Project structure: Your UI elements should be logically separated into React components (one file for each component) - at least 5 component files are required. In other words, you can’t just put all your JSX into 1-2 files.
   - Use Functional components instead of Class components

## How to run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
