# Lab 2 (Variant 10)  
## Requirements:
 - The website should be partly responsive: Required: for 320px (iPhone 5s)  2560px (4K screens). Hint: for extra-large screen width, you can just fit website content inside a previously set container for the regular screen width and centre it horizontally.
 - The header should collapse to a hamburger on small screens
 - The website must contain animations (at least 3). Can be made in any possible way, preferably with css properties (animation/transition).
 - Your project should be logically structured (all your CSS canâ€™t be in just one-two files)
 - All of the previous work requirements must be kept.
